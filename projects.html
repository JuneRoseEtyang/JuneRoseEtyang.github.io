	<li ><u>Database Systems project </u></li>
	<p style = "justify-content: left;"> The project entails designing a database system for a fashion house that
		would help the managers organize their employees who are the designers, sales team, marketing
		team and supervisors of the various departments for smooth workflow in the company. It will also
		have a feature that would keep track the of orders from their shops and online platforms. This will
		ensure that all orders from the customers have sold and shipped successfully. The system will also
		help the company manage their stock by keeping track of the inventory of their products available
		and the ones in demand. Another functionality of the database system is to help organize the
		models and the different categories of the products so ensure that the companyâ€™s brand is
		represented well. </p>
